Problem statement:
In the contemporary academic environment characterized by relentless academic pursuits, students find themselves immersed in the rigorous demands of their studies, often with limited opportunities to explore their creative inclinations beyond the confines of the classroom. Nevertheless, within this milieu of scholarly engagement, there exists a segment of students imbued with a fervent desire to channel their creativity into the realm of handicrafts, albeit hindered by the absence of a specialized platform conducive to showcasing and commercializing their talents. The prevalent landscape of traditional freelancing websites, predominantly monopolized by seasoned professionals, poses a formidable obstacle for these budding artisans, relegating their aspirations to the periphery of the marketplace. This inherent imbalance underscores the critical need for a bespoke platform tailored specifically to cater to the unique needs and aspirations of student artisans, thus affording them equitable opportunities to flourish and prosper in their craft.

severity of the problem:
The issue described underscores a significant gap in the current academic and professional landscape. Students, driven by a desire to explore their creative talents, are often constrained by the rigorous demands of their studies and the absence of platforms that cater specifically to their needs. This imbalance not only hinders the development of their artistic skills but also deprives them of potential avenues for personal and professional growth. Furthermore, the dominance of seasoned professionals on existing freelancing platforms exacerbates the problem, relegating student artisans to the sidelines of the marketplace and limiting their ability to showcase and commercialize their work. As a result, there is a pressing need for a specialized platform that provides these budding artisans with the support and opportunities they require to thrive in their craft and realize their full potential.
